# âš¡ Electric Vehicle Analysis Dashboard (Power BI)

## ðŸ“Š Overview

This project presents a comprehensive **Electric Vehicle (EV) analysis** using Power BI, designed to evaluate the adoption, distribution, and efficiency of EVs across the United States. It features detailed insights into Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) and Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs), helping stakeholders understand market trends, technological progress, and regional performance.

---

## ðŸ§© Problem Statement

The purpose of this analysis is to assess the **growth, efficiency, and adoption** of electric vehicles using public datasets. This involves tracking vehicle types, model year trends, manufacturer performance, and policy-based eligibility indicators like Clean Alternative Fuel Vehicle (CAFV) status.

## âœ… KPI Requirements

1. **Total Vehicles**
   - Measure the overall market size of EVs, including both BEVs and PHEVs.

2. **Average Electric Range**
   - Calculate average range to evaluate EV efficiency and technological advancements.

3. **Total BEV Vehicles & % of Total**
   - Analyze the volume and dominance of fully electric models in the market.

4. **Total PHEV Vehicles & % of Total**
   - Examine the share and role of plug-in hybrids within the EV ecosystem.
